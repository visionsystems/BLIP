Tasks
*****
On this page possible tasks for the Blip project are described.

Easy
====
 * Add more simple Vision algorithms to blipcode.py
 * Improve test coverage for interpreter.py
 * Add Idle mode to interpreter.py, along with Sleep/Wakeup opcodes
 * Improve the documentation!!

Moderate
========
 * Change the assembly format from objects to the compiler format
 * Improve the errors generated by the instruction matcher
 * Change the interpreter memory implementation to use array.array
 * Fix the code generation for the VJ version without full image
   there are small differences with the reference implementation due to
   reading too many values

Hard
====
 * Improve the peephole optimiser
 * Implement store sinking, note that VJ will not benefit from this optimisation
 * Improve the instruction -> SSA form convertor, a first version
   could use the same alloc/free information that the trace optimiser uses
 * If the instruction -> SSA convertor works, apply compiler optimisations
   in trace optimiser
 * Implement register spilling, this requires reserving a number of memory locations
   to store the spilled registers..
