* Compiler
  * Memory handling, allocate/free memory
  * Type system (also needed for memory system)
  * Index constants with register, this requires storing constants in memory
    depends on memory handling (we need to track free memory)
  * Spilling of variables to memory, also depends on memory handling
  * If ... else ... statements
  * Handling of memory accesses out of block (generate mov out, mem[fds]; mov rx, left sequences)

* Interpreter
  * Change opcode encoding to tuples with integers (major work!)
